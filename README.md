# Rock vs Mine Prediction | Logistic Regression

# 📌 Project Overview
## This machine learning project classifies sonar signals to determine whether an object detected underwater is a rock or a mine. The model is trained using logistic regression and analyzes 60 signal frequency readings to make predictions. The goal is to support underwater navigation and security systems by identifying potential threats.
